## Installation

---

<br>

1. First we need to install the dependencies, install project dependencies by running:


pip install -r requirements.txt


Dependencies include django-filters and django multiselectfield, responsible for filters, mails, share and Interest tags of opportunities.

<br>

2. Make and apply migrations by running:


python manage.py makemigrations


followed by:


python manage.py migrate


<br>

3. Run your local server by running:


python manage.py runserver


copy local host address and paste it in the browser's address bar.

<br>

4. Signup on the website to access all features and services.

<br>

5. Create a super user by running:


python manage.py createsuperuser


This step is important to add opportunities to featured list because I think only website's admin should be allowed to add opportunities to the featured list.

<br>
<br>
